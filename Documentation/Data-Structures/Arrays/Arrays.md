# Arrays

An array is a fundamental data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. It is one of the simplest and most widely used data structures in computer programming.

Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient access to elements using their index. The index of the first element is typically zero.

## Characteristics

- **Fixed Size**: Once declared, the size of an array cannot be altered. This is not the same for dynamically allocated arrays, as their size can be changed using the `realloc()` function in C and the `resize()` function in C++.
- **Homogeneous Elements**: All elements in an array must be of the same data type.
- **Random Access**: Elements can be accessed randomly using their index. The time complexity for this operation is O(1).

## Operations

- **Insertion**: Adding an element at a given index.
- **Deletion**: Removing an element from a given index.
- **Traversal**: Accessing each element in the array.
- **Searching**: Finding an element using its value or index.
- **Update**: Changing the value of an existing element.

## Use Cases

### Storing and Accessing Data
Arrays are used to store and manage data in a structured way. They are particularly useful when the number of elements is known beforehand.

### Implementing Other Data Structures
Many other data structures, like stacks and queues, are often implemented using arrays due to their simplicity and efficiency.

### Algorithmic Implementations
Arrays are commonly used in sorting and searching algorithms, such as binary search and quicksort.
