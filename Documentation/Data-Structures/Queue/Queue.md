# Queue

A queue is a **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** data structure, which means that the first elements added to the queue will be the first ones to be removed. This principle makes queues a widely used data structure in various computational scenarios.

Imagine a queue like a line of people waiting at a ticket counter. The first person to get in line is the first one to be served, and new people join at the end of the line. Just like this, elements in a queue are added (enqueued) at the back and removed (dequeued) from the front.

## Characteristics

- **Enqueue Operation**: Adding an element to the back of the queue.
- **Dequeue Operation**: Removing an element from the front of the queue.
- **Peek Operation**: Viewing the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
- **Time Complexity**: For all basic operations – enqueue, dequeue, and peek – the time complexity is O(1).

## Use Cases

### Order Processing
Queues are essential in situations where tasks need to be handled in the order they were received, such as in order processing systems.

### Buffering
Queues act as buffers in data processing and management systems, managing data flow between processes, especially when the receiving process is slower than the data sending process.

### Print Queue Management
In print management systems, print jobs are queued up in the order they are received and processed accordingly.

## Interactive Learning Resources

Enhance your understanding of queues with these interactive tools and visualizations:

1. [**Queue Visualization Tool**](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/QueueArray.html): An interactive tool to visualize the process of enqueuing and dequeuing in a queue.

2. [**Animation of Queue Operations**](https://visualgo.net/en/list): Demonstrates queue operations through animations, helping visualize the process.


These resources provide an interactive way to grasp the queue data structure and its operations, aiding in a more comprehensive learning experience. Do checkout the web visualization of the CSCI240 C++ Utility Library to see the queue in action!
