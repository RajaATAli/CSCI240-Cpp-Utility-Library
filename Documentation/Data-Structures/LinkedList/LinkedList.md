# LinkedList

A LinkedList is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object called a node. Each node contains a data element and a reference (or link) to the next node in the list. LinkedLists are a sequence of nodes, each connected to its successor, and possibly to its predecessor.

## Characteristics

- **Dynamic Size**: Unlike arrays, LinkedLists are not of fixed size. The size can increase or decrease as needed.
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Inserting or deleting nodes can be done efficiently at any point in the list.
- **Sequential Access**: Elements are accessed sequentially, starting from the first node (head). Random access is not feasible.

## Types of LinkedLists

- **Singly LinkedList**: Each node points only to the next node.
- **Doubly LinkedList**: Each node points to both its next and previous nodes.
- **Circular LinkedList**: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.

## Operations

- **Insertion**: Adding a node to the list.
- **Deletion**: Removing a node from the list.
- **Traversal**: Accessing each node in the list, usually starting from the head.
- **Searching**: Finding a node in the list using a given criterion.
- **Update**: Modifying the data of a node.

## Use Cases

### Dynamic Data Storage
LinkedLists are ideal for applications where the size of the data set changes dynamically and frequent insertions and deletions are required.

### Queue Implementation
LinkedLists are often used to implement queues, as they allow for constant time insertions and deletions.

### Image Viewer
LinkedLists are suitable for applications like image viewers where previous and next images are navigated, especially in the case of doubly LinkedLists.
