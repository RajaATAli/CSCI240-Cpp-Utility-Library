# Heap

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of C. The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.

## Characteristics

- **Types of Heaps**: The two common types are:
  - **Max Heap**: Parent nodes have greater value than their children.
  - **Min Heap**: Parent nodes have lesser value than their children.
- **Complete Binary Tree**: A heap is a complete binary tree, meaning all levels of the tree are fully filled, except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
- **Efficient Access**: The heap allows accessing the largest (max heap) or smallest (min heap) element in constant time O(1).

## Operations

- **Insertion**: Adding a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property. Time complexity is O(log n).
- **Deletion**: Removing the root element and reorganizing the heap to maintain the heap property. Time complexity is O(log n).
- **Heapify**: Rearranging elements to maintain the heap property. This is used during the insertion and deletion operations.

## Use Cases

### Priority Queues
Heaps are used to implement priority queues, where the queue retrieves elements based on priority rather than the order of insertion.

### Heap Sort
The heap data structure is used in the heap sort algorithm, which is an efficient sorting algorithm based on comparison.

### Graph Algorithms
Heaps are often used in graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and Prim's algorithms for finding the shortest path and minimum spanning tree, respectively.
