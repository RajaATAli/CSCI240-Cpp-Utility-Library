# Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a highly efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, meaning that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output.

## Algorithm Overview

Merge Sort divides the unsorted list into N sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted). Then, it repeatedly merges these sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining, which is the sorted list.

## Process

1. **Divide**: The list is divided into halves until each sublist contains a single element.
2. **Conquer**: Each pair of adjacent sublists is merged into a sorted list, recursively until one single sorted list remains.

## Characteristics

- **Divide and Conquer**: This algorithm divides the list into halves and combines them after sorting.
- **Stable Sorting**: Maintains the relative order of equal elements.
- **Not In-Place**: Requires additional space for merging, proportional to the size of the input array.

## Use Cases

- **Large Data Sets**: Particularly effective for sorting large data sets.
- **External Sorting**: Useful in external sorting where the data that needs to be sorted does not fit into RAM and resides in external storage.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) in all the three cases (worst, average, and best), as the merges are always divided into halves and the total number of merges equals log n.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the temporary arrays used in merging.
