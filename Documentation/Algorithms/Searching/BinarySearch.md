# Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

## Algorithm Overview

1. **Compare the Middle**: The algorithm compares the target value to the middle element of the array.
2. **Divide and Conquer**: If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search continues in the remaining half.
3. **Repeat or Conclude**: This process is repeated until the target value is found, or the entire array has been searched.

## Characteristics

- **Efficient for Large Lists**: Especially efficient when the list is large.
- **Sorted List Requirement**: The list must be sorted to apply binary search.
- **Divide and Conquer Approach**: The algorithm divides the list into halves, making the search process faster.

## Use Cases

- **Large Data Sets**: Particularly useful in searching large data sets.
- **Finding Elements in Sorted Arrays**: Commonly used to find elements in sorted arrays.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for iterative implementation, O(log n) for recursive implementation.
