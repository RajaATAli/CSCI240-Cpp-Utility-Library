## Description
This repository is dedicated to the students of CSCI240 (Computing II). It houses an Open-Source C++ Utility Library that captures a vast array of algorithms and data structures covered throughout the semester. The library is designed to be a practical tool for both current and future batches, blending theoretical understanding with real-world application. Contributing to this repository may also be a way to better prepare yourself for CSCI36200 (Data Structures and Algorithms)

## Goals
- **Knowledge Repository:** Serve as a go-to resource for current and future students, assisting them in reviewing and understanding key course concepts.
- **Hands-on Experience:** Provide students with the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world coding and collaborative environment.

## Installation
Instructions on how to clone and use the library locally will be provided as development progresses.

## Usage
Detailed documentation on specific algorithms, data structures, and utility functions will be made available in the respective directories. For practical examples and to understand how to use each algorithm or data structure, refer to the accompanying `demonstration.cpp` file provided in the respective directories.

## Directory Structure
- `Algorithms/`: Contains implementations of key algorithms.
- `Data-Structures/`: Houses various data structure implementations.
- `Tests/`: Unit tests for the library components.
- `Documentation/`: In-depth descriptions, use-cases, and examples for each algorithm and data structure.

## Contributing
